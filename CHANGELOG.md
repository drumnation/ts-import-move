### üìà PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS
- Small projects (< 10 files): ~1-2 seconds
- Medium projects (10-50 files): ~3-8 seconds
- Large projects (50-200 files): ~10-15 seconds
- Enterprise projects (200+ files): Scales linearly with streaming optimization

## [0.2.16] - 2025-04-20

### Fixed
- Resolved unit test failures related to module loading (`require` vs `import`) and incorrect mocking of `child_process.execSync`.
- Ensured `execMoveCommand` unit tests properly mock external system calls instead of attempting real `mv` operations.

### Added
- Added a new end-to-end (E2E) test (`cli-move-import-update.spec.ts`) to specifically verify that the CLI moves files *and* updates import paths correctly when run.
- Performed manual verification of the globally installed CLI tool to confirm the hybrid move-and-update approach works as expected.

## [0.2.14] - 2025-04-14

### Changed
- Version bump for release. No user-facing changes since 0.2.13, but ensures all dependencies and metadata are up to date.

## [0.2.13] - 2025-04-14

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical bug where the CLI, when run globally or from a published package, failed to move files using relative paths from a subdirectory ("No files matched the provided patterns"). The CLI now correctly passes original arguments to the main logic, preserving expected behavior for all path types and working directories.

### Added
- Added an end-to-end (E2E) test that runs the built CLI from a subdirectory using relative paths, ensuring this regression is caught in the future.

## [0.2.12] - 2025-04-15

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug with moving files using local relative paths when executed from subdirectories
- Enhanced directory structure preservation when moving files to ensure proper path resolution
- Improved handling of file paths to maintain relative paths correctly during moves

## [0.2.11] - 2025-04-14

### Fixed
- Fixed critical bug where moving a directory into another directory with `-r` would flatten the directory structure and cause file collisions. The tool now preserves the full hierarchy by creating a subfolder in the destination matching the source directory name, just like standard `mv` behavior.
- The original source directory is now removed after a successful move, matching expected CLI semantics.

### Added
- Added an integration test to ensure directory structure is preserved when moving a directory with subfolders into another directory. This prevents regressions for this critical behavior.

### Changed
- Improved move logic to handle single-directory moves robustly and safely, with better error handling and verbose output for debugging.

## [0.2.10] - 2025-04-14

### Fixed
- Fixed Commander.js CLI definition to use a single variadic argument (`<args...>`) and parse sources/destination in code, resolving the "only the last argument can be variadic" error for all users.
- Ensured CLI works with all argument patterns and passes all e2e tests.

## [0.2.9] - 2025-04-14

### Changed
- Upgraded Vitest to v3.1.1 for improved concurrency and stability.
- Refactored test scripts to remove unsupported CLI concurrency flags; concurrency is now set in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Removed unsupported `project.dispose()` call from ts-morph usage for compatibility.
- Fixed all ESLint and TypeScript errors in `src/lib/index.ts` (unused variables, quote style).
- All core CLI, integration, and e2e tests now pass reliably.
- Isolated memory issues to a single non-critical test (`cli-install-rules`).
- Split memory-intensive test from main suite for reliable CI and publishing.

### Fixed
- Memory issues in test suite by splitting test runs and optimizing project usage.
- Test failures due to missing log output in CLI.

## [0.2.8] - 2025-04-14

### Fixed
- Fixed critical bug where CLI argument order was reversed, causing source and destination parameters to be swapped
- Added test case to verify correct parameter order processing
- Fixed Commander.js constraint violation that prevented the CLI from working when variadic parameters weren't last
- Implemented smart parameter handling to allow multiple source files while maintaining the correct source-to-destination semantics

## [0.2.7] - 2025-04-14

### Fixed
- Fixed critical bug where file movement commands completed silently without actually moving files
- Connected CLI commands to the actual implementation in the moveAction function
- Fixed E2E CLI test for `install-rules` command by using direct mock instead of trying to import the unexported `program` variable from index.ts
- Fixed verbose CLI test by ensuring destination directory exists before test

## [0.2.6] - 2025-04-13

### Added
- Added project root detection for more accurate local rule installation
- Made local installation (project-specific) the default installation option

## [0.2.5] - 2025-04-13
