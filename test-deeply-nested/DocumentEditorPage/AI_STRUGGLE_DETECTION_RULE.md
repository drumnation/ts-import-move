# AI Struggle Detection & Structural Analysis Rule

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY AI SELF-AWARENESS RULE

### **The "Three Strike Structural Analysis" Rule**

**TRIGGER CONDITION**: When ANY of these patterns occur within a single task:

1. **Multiple Failed Attempts** (3+ unsuccessful changes to same area)
2. **Deep Navigation Confusion** (searching >3 levels of nesting for simple fixes)
3. **File Path Uncertainty** (uncertainty about which file handles a visual element)
4. **Abstract Name Confusion** (encountering files with unclear visual mapping)
5. **Scattered Logic Changes** (fixing one issue requires changes across >4 unrelated files)

### **MANDATORY RESPONSE PROTOCOL**

When ANY trigger condition is met, AI MUST:

1. **PAUSE** current implementation work
2. **DECLARE** the struggle pattern detected
3. **PROPOSE** structural analysis using this template:

```
ðŸš¨ STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY DETECTED ðŸš¨

**Struggle Pattern**: [describe which trigger condition was met]
**Area Affected**: [component/feature name]
**Evidence**: [specific examples of confusion/failed attempts]

**RECOMMENDATION**: Conduct structural analysis and refactoring strategy before continuing.

**Proposed Analysis**:
1. Map current file structure vs. visual elements
2. Identify naming and organization issues
3. Create AI-friendly refactoring plan
4. Implement structural improvements

**Question for Human**: Should I pause feature work and conduct this structural analysis now?
```
