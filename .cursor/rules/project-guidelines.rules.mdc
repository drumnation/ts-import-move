# Rule: Auto-generate and maintain PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md

Purpose:
Document architectural decisions, naming conventions, and structure to keep the team aligned.

When to run:
- When new packages/apps are added to the monorepo
- When naming, structure, or styling conventions change
- When deployment or integration workflows are updated

Include:
- Tech stack overview (frontend, backend, DB)
- Folder structure and purpose (`apps/`, `packages/`)
- Naming conventions for files, types, and functions
- Component standards (hooks only, styled-components usage)
- Deployment strategy (Vercel, AWS, preview vs prod)

Format:
Clean markdown with collapsible sections or bullet points for quick reference.
